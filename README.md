Hover Strawberry Cake

This mini project was created for pure fun and a way to relearn HTML and CSS since I'm studying JavaScript right now.

Built with:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure.
CSS: For styling and animations.

Project Structure
Here are the key files and their purposes:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the animated sandwich.
style.css: The CSS file that styles the sandwich and adds animations.

Animations
The strawberry on top of the cake floats when your cursor hovers over it.
